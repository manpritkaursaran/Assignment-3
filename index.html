      <p class="first">Research for a recent brand vision project highlighted what is perhaps the best global brand campaign ever:<br> ’You’re not you when you’re hungry’, by Snickers. We tipped the campaign for the top early in its history,<br>
         back in this 2012 post. Since then its has run for an impressive six and a half years in an amazing 58 markets.<br> Global brand sales of the billion dollar brand have grown by 15.9% and the work has won many major effectiveness awards, <br>
         including two Effectiveness Lions and an IPA Gold. 

        We explore the Snickers case study in detail on our Mastering Brand Growth program on our brandgym Academy online training platform here. <br>
        In particular, we use it to look at how to find a universal insight that appeals to a core target AND a broader audience.
        Mars was an early adopter of Byron Sharp’s work, focusing Snickers on penetration to attract more buyers into the brand.<br> This meant creating a distinctive communication platform that could drive salience for Snickers,
         attracting new buyers and reminding lapsed buyers about the brand.<br> The platform to work needed to enable building of distinctive brand assets across all touchpoints.</p>

        <h><b> History:</b></h>
      <p2 class="description">Snickers is a chocolate bar made by the American company Mars,named after the favorite horse of the mars family.
        The bar was marketed under the name "Marathon" in the UK and Ireland until 1990, when Mars decided to align the UK product with the global 
        Snickers name (Mars had marketed and discontinued an unrelated bar named Marathon in the United States during the 1970s which was similar 
        to the UK's Curly Wurly). There are also several other Snickers products such as Snickers mini, dark chocolate, ice cream bars, Snickers 
        with almonds, Snickers with hazelnuts, Snickers with pecans, Snickers peanut butter bars, Snickers protein and Snickers with Extra Caramel,
         as well as espresso, fiery, and sweet & salty versions
